Churn is used to churn a number of files by a % changerate.

Example:

./churn -v 10% /path/to/files

This will create files adding 10% total space to the file path.

./churn -d -v 20% /path/to/files

This will change 20% of the total size of data, by deleting files and
creating newer ones, to simulate daily data change rates.

You will need to set 3 options in the churn script before running it:

MIN_SIZE - Minimum filesize to be created
MAX_SIZE - Maximum filesize to be created
MAX_FILES_PER_DIRECTORY - Maximum files per data directory

Churn requires 'dd' to be in your path as well as access to /dev/urandom
